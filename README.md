## 2023
I swear I'm going to do these in rust

## 2022
README files in each day's directory show how to produce the solutions - input
data is not included though, you'll have to grab that yourself.

I finished the first 14 days, but fell behind after that - I have solutions for
part 1 on days 15, 18, and 21 only.


##  2021
I used perl for the first two in, and python for the rest.  I fell behind very
quickly, caught up by day seven, but from day eight onwards I was never fully
on track.

My last pushed commit was Feb 1st; by then I had solved up to day 18, and also
the first parts of days 21 & 23 - day 23 with pen and paper, so I have a single
star for that day but nothing in the repo.
