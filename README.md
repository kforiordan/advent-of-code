Solutions to the 2021 & 2022 Advent of Code puzzles.

##  2021
I used perl for the first two in, and python for the rest that year.  I
fell behind very quickly, but by day 7 had caught up.  By day 14 I was barely
on top of things, and after that I fell hopelessly behind.  My last pushed
commit was Feb 1st; by then I had solved up to day 18, and also the first parts
of days 21 & 23 - day 23 with pen and paper, so I have a single star for that
day but nothing in the repo.
